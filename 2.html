When it is specified in inline CSS(<style></style>) then colour specified there is shown and if !important is not specified in both inline and external CSS, then internal CSS of an element is given utmost importance.

        American media franchise
        and shared universe centered on a series of superhero films produced by Marvel Studios. The films are based on
        characters
        that appear in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The franchise also includes television series,
        short films, digital series, and literature. The shared universe, much like the original Marvel Universe in
        comic books, was established by crossing over common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters.</h1>

        phases collectively known as "The Infinity Saga" and the following three phases as "The Multiverse Saga". The
        first MCU film, Iron Man (2008), began Phase One, which culminated in the 2012 crossover film The Avengers.
        Phase Two began with Iron Man 3 (2013) and concluded with Ant-Man (2015). Phase Three began with Captain
        America: Civil War (2016) and concluded with Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019). Phase Four began with Black Widow
        (2021) and concluded with Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022). Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023) began
        Phase Five, which will end with Captain America: Brave New World (2025), and Phase Six will begin with Fantastic
        Four (2025). Phase Six and "The Multiverse Saga" will conclude with Avengers 5 (2026) and Avengers: Secret Wars
        (2027).<br></h1>

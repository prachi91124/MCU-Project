        <p>The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is an American media franchise and shared universe centered on a series
            of superhero films produced by Marvel Studios. The films are based on characters that appear in American
            comic books published by Marvel Comics. The franchise also includes television series, short films, digital
            series, and literature. The shared universe, much like the original Marvel Universe in comic books, was
            established by crossing over common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters.</p>

            <h1>Contributors</h1>

            <p>As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, I don't have access to the internet or real-time
                databases, so I can't provide the most current information on contributors to the Marvel Cinematic
                Universe (MCU). However, I can give you a general idea of key contributors up to that point. Keep in
                mind that this information might have changed since then.

            <ul>

                <li>Kevin Feige:** President of Marvel Studios and a key architect of the MCU.</li>

                <li>Stan Lee (1922-2018):** Co-creator of many Marvel characters and a significant figure in the
                    development of the MCU.</li>

                <li>Jon Favreau:** Director of "Iron Man" and "Iron Man 2," and an executive producer on several MCU    films.</li>

                <li>Joss Whedon:** Director of "The Avengers" and "Avengers: Age of Ultron."</li>

                <li>Anthony and Joe Russo:** Directed several MCU films, including "Captain America: The Winter Soldier," "Captain America: Civil War," "Avengers: Infinity War," and "Avengers: Endgame."</li>

                <li>James Gunn:** Director of the "Guardians of the Galaxy" films and "The Suicide Squad."</li>

                <li>Robert Downey Jr.:** Portrayed Tony Stark/Iron Man and played a significant role in the success of the MCU.</li>

                <li>Chris Evans:** Portrayed Steve Rogers/Captain America and had a substantial impact on the franchise.
                </li>

                <li>Chris Hemsworth:** Portrayed Thor and played a crucial role in the "Thor" series and "Avengers"
                    films.</li>

                <li>Scarlett Johansson:** Portrayed Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow and had a significant presence in
                    multiple MCU films.</li>

            </ul>

                This list is not exhaustive, and there are many other directors, writers, actors, and crew members who have
                contributed to the success of the MCU. For the most current and comprehensive list, I recommend checking
                official sources, such as the credits of the latest MCU films or the Marvel Studios website.
